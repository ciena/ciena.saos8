SAOS8_COMMAND    

        Sends arbitrary commands to a saos node and returns the
        results read from the device. This module includes an argument
        that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
        before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= commands
        List of commands to send to the remote saos device over the
        configured provider. The resulting output from the command is
        returned. If the `wait_for' argument is provided, the module
        is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number
        of retries has expired. If a command sent to the device
        requires answering a prompt, it is possible to pass a dict
        containing `command', `answer' and `prompt'. Common answers
        are 'y' or "\r" (carriage return, must be double quotes). See
        examples.


- interval
        Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of
        the command. If the command does not pass the specified
        conditions, the interval indicates how long to wait before
        trying the command again.
        [Default: 1]

- match
        The `match' argument is used in conjunction with the
        `wait_for' argument to specify the match policy.  Valid values
        are `all' or `any'.  If the value is set to `all' then all
        conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If the value
        is set to `any' then only one of the values must be satisfied.
        (Choices: any, all)[Default: all]

- retries
        Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried
        before it is considered failed. The command is run on the
        target device every retry and evaluated against the `wait_for'
        conditions.
        [Default: 10]

- wait_for
        List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the
        command. The task will wait for each condition to be true
        before moving forward. If the conditional is not true within
        the configured number of retries, the task fails. See
        examples.
        (Aliases: waitfor)[Default: (null)]
